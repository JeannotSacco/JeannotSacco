# Hi, I'm Jean ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing a double degree in **Engineering** and **Business Administration** at EDHEC Business School and UTC. I am passionate about the intersection of **finance and technology**, and I enjoy tackling challenges that mix analytical thinking with innovative solutions.  

During my exchange in Shanghai, I discovered how exciting the global financial world can be, which strengthened my ambition to work in international finance. I enjoy working in dynamic environments, taking initiative, and learning by doing.  

ðŸ’¼ **I am looking for an internship in finance with a strong technology component, starting January 2026.**  

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out!
